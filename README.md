Assignment 4 - DVD Rent Store

A local movie rental store wishes to automate its inventory tracking system. Currently, there are three types of movies/videos (in DVD media) to be tracked:
- Comedy (denoted as ‘F’ for funny)
- Drama (denoted as ‘D’)
- Classics (denoted as ‘C’)

Borrows and returns of items by customers are also to be tracked. Four types of actions are desired in the system:
- Borrow (denoted as ‘B’): (stock – 1) for each item borrowed
- Return (denoted as ‘R’): (stock + 1) for each item returned
- Inventory (denoted as ‘I’): outputs the inventory of all the items in the store
- History (denoted as ‘H’): outputs all the transactions of a customer
